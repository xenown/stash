# stash
Store and browse your financial data privately forever.

The goal of this project was to provide myself with a way to pull and store
financial data with minimal 3rd party involvement. 

It is effectively a fancy cron job with a cross-platform UI slapped on top.
Data is stored completely locally in a SQLite file.

Using this software requires setting up your own Plaid secret API keys (and
therefore paying for their service yourself).

This software consists of a backend to pull the data and a simple front end to
read the data.
